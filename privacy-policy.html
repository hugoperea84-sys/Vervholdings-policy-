    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Clarity is a private internal finance tool used exclusively by authorized personnel. It is not intended for public or consumer use.</p>

    <h2>Data Access and Usage</h2>
    <p>Clarity connects to QuickBooks Online using Intuit OAuth 2.0 with explicit user authorization. It accesses only the data required for internal reporting and reconciliation, including account balances, transactions, vendors, and invoices.</p>
    <p>No other data is collected. Access is read-only and strictly limited to authorized personnel.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>No data is sold, shared, or disclosed to third parties. All data is stored securely and is accessible only to authorized users.</p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>Users may revoke access to their QuickBooks Online account at any time through Intuit or the application settings. Revoked access prevents the application from retrieving the user’s data.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>All sensitive information is encrypted in transit and at rest. The application follows industry-standard security practices to maintain confidentiality and data integrity.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact: <a href="mailto:hugo@vervholdings.com">hugo@vervholdings.com</a></p>
